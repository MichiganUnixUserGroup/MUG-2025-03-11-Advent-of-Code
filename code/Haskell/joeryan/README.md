To run this code, you will need a haskell compiler that supports GHC2021, which are all GHC >= 9.2.1
$ ghc day1r2.hs
$ ./day1r2 sample.txt

[Install the haskell compiler with GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)

day1-round1.hs is less complete, requires 2 input files, but was an interesting step along the way
day1r2.hs accepts a filename as an argument and uses a single function to transform the input
